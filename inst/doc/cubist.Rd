\section{Version 0.0.8: 2011-06-21}{
    A bug was fixed for the \code{coef} method.
  }

\section{Version 0.0.6: 2011-04-28}{
    The GPL version was revised to be version 3 (thanks to Ross Quinlan for the note).

    The variable usage statistics were saved to a data frame in called \code{object$usage}. The package vignette and help files were updated accordingly.

    When using \code{cubist}, if \code{x} was a vector or a single variable, an error occurred. This was fixed.

    The vignette was also expanded to show how \pkg{caret} can be used to tune the model and a technical error was corrected about the boosting algorithm (thanks again to Ross Quinlan).

\section{Initial Version: 2011-04-22}{
